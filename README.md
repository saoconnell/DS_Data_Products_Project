Data Science - Data Products Project - Shiny App

# Description

The following application was developed for the Cousera Data Science, Data Products class.  

I work as a performance test engineer for a major utility.  Our group is reposible for 
test any new or major releases to the application software the used by the utility.
We use automated tools to simulate the workload on the application using "virtual users" 
to represent the real users.  



To setup a simulation the user interactions with the application are recorded  or scripted
and the scripts are parameterized with data to make each user interation unique.  For 
example a login script would be parameterized with different userid/password combinations.

After the scripts have been developed, scenarios need to be developed
